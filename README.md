# Crawly_client
Distributed web indexing made easy.

Talks to the Crawly_server to get a list of URLs, scrape them for more URLs, and return the results back to the tracker.
Crawly_server will be open sourced after I clean it up a little more.


Your help would be appreciated in improving the code, especially the efficiency and error handling.
